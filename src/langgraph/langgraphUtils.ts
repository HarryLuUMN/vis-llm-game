// TODO:
// 1. using a global variable to store whether the workflow is start or not
// 2. using that variable to determine when should we show up the Start Workflow btn
// 3. using parallelZone to construct a more flexible data map represents the relationship between agents and locations
// 4. write a tranformation function here to convert the data map into a langgraph Graph
